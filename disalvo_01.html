            "Rhetoric is a liberal art that provides a structured way of understanding and acting in the world... Design makes arguments: the products of design assert claims about how the world is, could be, or should be."

                <p><strong>Design and Argument:</strong> DiSalvo draws from Richard Buchanan's idea that design is a contemporary form of rhetoric, arguing that every product or design makes an argument about how the world should be.</p>
                <p><strong>Comparative Products:</strong> By comparing products like Android phones and iPhones, DiSalvo highlights how design shapes interactions and experiences, thereby making different arguments about user engagement.</p>

                <p><strong>Practicing Design as Rhetoric:</strong> DiSalvo encourages practicing design as a form of societal shaping, where design becomes an expression of individual and collective desires and values.</p>

                <p><strong>Design Fiction:</strong> Similar to science fiction, speculative design uses physical and digital prototypes rather than narrative text to make its arguments, often requiring interpretation to reveal underlying messages.</p>

                <p><strong>Political Implications:</strong> DiSalvo's work also explores the politics of participatory design, examining how co-design reflects or challenges political ideologies in the twenty-first century, especially in relation to democracy.</p>
